# foodTruckLocate
This application is used in order to find Food Trucks in a specified area.
It is created using the Google Maps API.

The user is able to enter in an address, city, state, place or zip code and the map will center in on that area and list food trucks in that area.
The listed Food Trucks will also show on the map with a green icon. 
When the user clicks on the icon or list item, the display window will show the name, a picture, address, and if it's listed, the phone number, website, hours open, and a review.

If the user clicks on the "Use My Location" button, the map will center on that person's current location with a pop up as well as all the other information.
